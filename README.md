# A solution to the Concurrent Benchmark (2nd challenge) in Beluga
The Concurrent Calculi Formalisation Benchmark is a set of challenges which address problems typically encountered during the mechanization of models of concurrent and distributed programming languages: see [concurrentbenchmark.github.io](https://concurrentbenchmark.github.io/) for a thorough description of the challenge problems and a collection of their submitted solutions. In particular, the second challenge involves reasoning about scope extrusion, i.e. the fact that a process can send a restricted name to another process, provided that the restriction is expanded to include the receiving process.

This repository contains a solution to the second challenge of the Benchmark in the proof assistant Beluga, by Alberto Momigliano and Gabriele Cecilia. The Beluga sources can be found in directory [code](code) and are type-checked with Beluga version 1.1.1. The file [thesis](thesis.pdf) is a Master's thesis by Gabriele Cecilia providing a detailed informal and formal explanation of this work.
