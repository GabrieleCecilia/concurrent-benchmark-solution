# concurrent-benchmark-solution
The Concurrent Calculi Formalisation Benchmark is a set of challenges which address problems typically encountered during the mechanization of models of concurrent and distributed programming languages: see [concurrentbenchmark.github.io](https://concurrentbenchmark.github.io/) for a thorough description of the challenge problems and a collection of their submitted solutions. In particular, the second challenge involves reasoning about scope extrusion, i.e. the fact that a process can send a restricted name to another process, provided that the restriction is expanded to include the receiving process.

This repository contains a solution to the second challenge of the Benchmark in the proof assistant Beluga, by Alberto Momigliano and Gabriele Cecilia. The Beluga sources can be found in directory [code](code). The file [thesis](thesis.pdf) is a Master's thesis by Gabriele Cecilia providing a detailed informal and formal explanation of this work.
